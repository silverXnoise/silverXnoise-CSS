# Silver & Noise CSS
===

### Extended markdown CSS, specifically for using with Marked 2 previews from Drafts on MacOS.

This is a personal set of CSS rules for formatting Multimarkdown in Marked 2. Feel free to copy it if you'd like, all fonts are embedded into the CSS as base64 @font-face declarations.
